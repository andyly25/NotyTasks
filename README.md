# NotyTasks
Is it read as Know thy tasks?

Is it read as Nody Tasks? since it's made using Node

Is it No thank you Tasks?

In the end the thing that it has in common is that you edit and manage tasks.

## Current Goals:
- Implement Date and Time correctly
- add in a Sign Out
- Separate Tasks into categories organized by most recent tasks due
- Prettify with CSS and things
- Then add extra features like e-mail
  - or using info to make a calender event


### Other ideas
- Users on add/edit can create their own categories
- a way to notify completion/due date of tasks
- create a popup of some kind to make add task quickly
- a starter template for task
